## Introduction
Our robot is an intelligent, mobile robot that visually inspects plants using a Raspberry Pi, then uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o-mini Vision model to analyze plant health. If a plant appears dry or wilted, it automatically triggers watering. At the end of each session (once per day), the robot sends a email to the user's email address.
